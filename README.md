## AI-Based Patient Meal Planning and Delivery Optimization
## üìå Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning and optimization techniques to automate patient meal recommendations and enhance hospital meal delivery efficiency. By analyzing patient data, the system provides personalized meal plans while optimizing delivery schedules to reduce waste and improve resource management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP
Optimization Techniques: Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
Data Handling: CSV-based patient meal datasets

##üîß How It Works
Data Collection: Gathers patient details (health conditions, dietary preferences, allergies).
Meal Recommendation: ML models predict suitable meals based on patient health conditions.
Optimization Algorithms: Advanced techniques optimize meal delivery schedules for efficiency.
Implementation: Hospitals use the system to automate meal planning and reduce operational costs.
